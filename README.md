### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a climate scientist and engineer.
Around GitHub, you'll find me contributing to open source projects like [Xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) and [Pangeo](https://github.com/pangeo-data).
Previously, I was a co-founder and the technology director at CarbonPlan, a non-profit working on data science and policy issues surrounding carbon removal and climate solutions, and a project scientist in the Climate and Global Dynamics Laboratory at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
I'm a licensed Profession Engineer and I have a Ph.D. in [Civil and Environmental Engineering from the University of Washington](https://www.ce.washington.edu/).
