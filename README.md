### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a climate scientist and engineer. I am the technology director at [CarbonPlan](https://carbonplan.org), a non-profit working on data science and policy issues surrounding carbon removal and climate solutions. I also hold a position in the the [Climate and Global Dynamics Laboratory](https://www.cgd.ucar.edu/) at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/). I have a Ph.D. in [Civil and Environmental Engineering from the University of Washington](https://www.ce.washington.edu/).  Around here (GitHub), you'll find me contributing to open source projects like [Xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) and [Pangeo](https://github.com/pangeo-data).
